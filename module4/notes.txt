What is a Semaphore?
A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used to control access to shared resources in concurrent programming. It allows you to limit the number of threads that can access a resource or perform an operation at the same time.

There are two types of semaphores:

Binary Semaphore : Acts like a mutex (lock), allowing only one thread to access a resource at a time.
Counting Semaphore : Allows a specified number of threads to access a resource simultaneously.
